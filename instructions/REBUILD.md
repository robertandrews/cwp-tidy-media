# WordPress Media Management Plugin Rebuild Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the approach for rebuilding a WordPress media management plugin that provides advanced organization and control over the WordPress Media Library. The goal is to create a more robust, maintainable, and efficient solution.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Media Organization System
- Implement a flexible file organization system that supports:
  - Custom directory structures based on post types
  - Taxonomy-based organization
  - Date-based organization (YYYY/MM)
  - Post-specific organization (by slug or ID)
- Use WordPress's native upload directory filters instead of manual file operations
- Implement proper database transaction handling for file operations

### 2. Remote Media Management
- Download and localize remote images from post content
- Implement proper validation and sanitization of remote URLs
- Add support for various media types (images, videos, PDFs)
- Include configurable domain whitelist
- Implement rate limiting and batch processing for downloads

### 3. URL Management
- Convert absolute URLs to relative URLs in post content
- Handle URL updates across different environments
- Implement proper URL parsing and validation
- Add support for multisite installations
- Include CDN compatibility

### 4. Attachment Management
- Smart attachment cleanup system:
  - Verify media usage across all content before deletion
  - Handle deletion of associated image sizes
  - Maintain database consistency
- Implement proper file locking during operations
- Add recovery mechanisms for failed operations

## Technical Architecture

```

### 2. Database Design
- Use WordPress custom tables with proper schema versioning
- Implement efficient indexing for media queries
- Store configuration in a serialized format
- Include proper upgrade/downgrade paths

### 3. Processing Architecture
- Implement background processing for bulk operations
- Use WordPress cron for scheduled tasks
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Add support for operation rollback

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. File Operations
- Use WordPress filesystem abstraction (WP_Filesystem)
- Implement proper file locking mechanisms
- Handle concurrent access properly
- Include backup mechanisms before file operations

### 2. Security Measures
- Implement proper nonce verification
- Add capability checks for all operations
- Sanitize and validate all input/output
- Follow WordPress security best practices

### 3. Performance Considerations
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use batch processing for bulk operations
- Optimize database queries
- Implement proper cleanup routines

## User Interface

### 1. Settings Page
- Create intuitive organization rule configuration
- Implement live preview of file paths
- Add bulk operation controls
- Include proper validation feedback

### 2. Media Library Integration
- Add custom columns for organization info
- Implement bulk actions in media library
- Add filtering options based on organization rules

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- Test core functionality in isolation
- Implement proper mocking for filesystem operations
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test interaction with WordPress core
- Verify database operations
- Test file system operations

### 3. Performance Tests
- Test with large media libraries
- Verify memory usage
- Test concurrent operations

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. Installation
- Implement proper activation hooks
- Add database table creation
- Set default settings

### 2. Updates
- Implement version checking
- Add update routines
- Include rollback capabilities

### 3. Uninstallation
- Clean up database tables
- Remove plugin settings
- Provide option to keep/remove organized files

## Documentation Requirements

### 1. Code Documentation
- Follow WordPress coding standards
- Document all hooks and filters
- Include inline code documentation

### 2. User Documentation
- Create comprehensive setup guide
- Document all features and settings
- Include troubleshooting guide

## Future Considerations

### 1. Extensibility
- Implement proper hook system
- Add filter points for customization
- Create addon architecture

### 2. Integration
- Add REST API support
- Include CLI commands
- Support popular media plugins

This rebuild guide focuses on creating a more robust and maintainable solution while addressing the limitations and issues of the current implementation. The new architecture emphasizes proper error handling, security, and performance while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
